This is a cruisecontrol.rb plugin for sending build status changes to your cell phone.  

Steps to install:
1. Drop the sms_notifier.rb file into the builder_plugins/installed directory of your cruise instance

2. Add the following lines to your project's cruise_config.rb.  This is a list.  Add as many as you like.
  #sms_notifier configuration
  project.sms_notifier.recipients = ['555-555-5555']

3. Make sure you have the smtp configuration setup in your site_config.rb file.  The sms is sent via email.

Note.  This plugin makes use of the teleflip.com 'flipout' service which allows sms to be sent via email.  I have read their license pretty closely, and as long as you aren't adding recipients to be notified without their consent you are not violating the terms of service.  However I am no lawyer, so I might be wrong.  You must go read and agree to teleflip.com terms of service before you can use this plugin!

Enjoy.
